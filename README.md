Hello and welcome to your very own Hangman game!

To utilize this application, one step needs to be take.
On line 22 of the application inside of the main class, where the scanner is made, there is a set of quotation marks, and within them you need to add the filename for the word.txt that I have added to the repo!
This is to ensure that if you decide to play the single player version, you will have a surplus of words at your disposal to guess.

This application has a 1 player and 2 player option. After running the application, you choose how many players you want to participate.
If you choose the 1 player option then you opt in for the application to pick a word for you. You then have 6 chances to guess the word!

If you choose to play with a friend, then whoever choses to be player one gets to pick a word and type it out.
Player 2 has 6 chances to get the right word until the game is over and the word is revealed!

Happy playing!
